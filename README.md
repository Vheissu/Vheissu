# Dwayne Charrington

I build front-ends that are fast, accessible, and boring in all the right ways. Aurelia 2 core team. Open source. Systems thinker working from first principles, always collaborating to push the web forward.

## What I do
- Front-end: design systems, component libraries, clean patterns that scale
- Migrations and rescues: Aurelia 1 to 2, legacy JS to modern, flaky builds to stable pipelines
- Product delivery: WordPress and Firebase when itâ€™s right, AWS when it needs teeth

**Available for**: front-end development, design systems, Aurelia 2 migrations, Tailwind architectures, WordPress, Firebase, serverless, complex web apps.
