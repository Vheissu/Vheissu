# Dwayne Charrington

Senior front end engineer who ships end to end products. I work across front end, back end, and infrastructure, and I’m comfortable owning systems long after the first deploy. Core contributor to Aurelia 2, long time open source maintainer, and someone who thinks about systems, not just screens.

I care about building software that survives real usage, not just demos.

---

## What I do
I design and build web products from zero to production, then keep them healthy.

That usually means:
- Front end architecture and component systems that don’t rot
- Full stack work across Node.js, PHP, databases, and APIs
- Infrastructure and deployment when it’s needed, not as a separate team
- Fixing messy legacy systems and modernising them without breaking the business
- Making pragmatic technical calls instead of chasing trends

Available for senior front end roles, full stack product work, migrations, and systems that need an adult in the room.

- Bias toward shipping
- Prefer boring solutions that last
- Comfortable taking ownership when things are unclear
- Optimize for long term sanity, not short term optics
