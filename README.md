# Dwayne Charrington

Senior front-end engineer with deep full-stack and infrastructure experience. I build fast, accessible web apps that scale, stay maintainable, and ship without drama. Core contributor to Aurelia 2, long-time open source maintainer, and systems-focused engineer who thinks beyond the UI.

I care about clean architecture, predictable delivery, and software that holds up under real traffic.

---

## What I do
- Front-end engineering: scalable component systems, design systems, performance-first UI  
- Full-stack delivery: Node.js, PHP, serverless, relational and NoSQL data stores  
- Platform and infra work: AWS, Azure, Firebase, CI/CD, production hardening  
- Migrations and rescues: legacy JavaScript to modern stacks, framework upgrades, build and pipeline fixes  
- Product engineering: choosing boring, proven tools when they make sense and sharp tools when they matter  

**Available for**: senior front-end roles, full-stack projects, design systems, large-scale web apps, migrations, infrastructure-heavy products.
