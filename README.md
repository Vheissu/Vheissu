# Dwayne Charrington

Full-stack engineer who ships end to end products. I work across front end, back end, databases, APIs, mobile and infrastructure, and I'm comfortable owning systems long after the first deploy. Core contributor to Aurelia, long time open source maintainer, and someone who thinks about systems, not just screens. I ❤️ open source a lot.

I care about building software that survives real usage, not just demos. No vibecoding here, just coding.

## What I do
I design and build web products from zero to production, then keep them healthy.

That usually means:
- Full stack product development across Node.js, PHP, Python, databases and APIs
- Front end architecture and component systems that don't rot
- Native mobile applications (Android and iOS) using React Native
- Infrastructure, CI/CD and deployment as part of the build, not a separate team
- Fixing messy legacy systems and modernising them without breaking the business
- Making pragmatic technical calls instead of chasing trends
- Choosing boring stable stacks over hype stacks, frameworks and libraries

Available for senior full stack roles, front-end, product engineering, migrations, and systems that need an adult in the room.

## How I work
- Bias toward shipping
- Prefer boring solutions that last
- Comfortable taking ownership when things are unclear
- Optimise for long term sanity, not short term optics
