# Dwayne Charrington

Front-end architect shipping fast, accessible, boring-in-the-best-way web apps. Aurelia 2 core team. Pragmatic full stack when it moves the needle.

## What I do
- Front-end leadership: design systems, component libraries, clean patterns that scale
- Migrations and rescues: Aurelia 1 to 2, legacy JS to modern, flaky builds to stable pipelines
- Product delivery: WordPress and Firebase when it’s right, AWS when it needs teeth

**Available for**: front-end leadership, design systems, Aurelia 2 migrations, Tailwind architectures, WordPress, Firebase, serverless, complex web apps.
